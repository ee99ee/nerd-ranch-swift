# Chapter 4: Bronze Challange
* Question
Set down your computer and grab a pencil and paper for this challenge. What is the binary representation of -1 using an 8-bit signed integer? If you took that same bit pattern and interpreted it as an 8-bit unsigned integer, what would the value be?

Unsigned 8-bit: 10000001 = -1
Signed 8-bit binary: 10000001 = 129
